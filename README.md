📊 Production Efficiency Analysis of EcoDrive Innovations

I recently conducted a Production Performance Analysis for EcoDrive Innovations, evaluating production center efficiency, overall production trends, and monthly performance. Here’s what I discovered:

🚀 Production Center Performance:
✅ Target Achieved:
🔹 Bangalore – Target: 24,000, Actual: 24,600
🔹 Chennai – Target: 27,700, Actual: 30,800
🔹 Delhi – Target: 20,400, Actual: 21,500
🔹 Kolkata – Target: 25,300, Actual: 25,300
🔹 Ahmedabad – Target: 19,200, Actual: 19,500

⚠️ Target Missed:
🔻 Mumbai – Target: 23,700, Actual: 23,600
🔻 Jaipur – Target: 18,300, Actual: 15,100

📊 Production Overview:
📌 Total Production: 160,400 units over 6 months
📌 Number of Production Centers: 7
📌 Average Production per Month: 26,733 units
📌 Average Production per Center: 22,914 units

📉 Month-Wise Production Analysis:

January: 21,700 units (Lowest)
February: 24,700 units
March: 26,900 units
April: 26,200 units
May: 29,100 units
June: 31,800 units (Highest)
💡 Key Insights:
🔹 Chennai was the top-performing center, producing 30,800 units.
🔹 Jaipur significantly underperformed, producing only 15,100 units, highlighting a need for improvement.
🔹 June had the highest production (31,800 units), showing a positive growth trend.
🔹 January had the lowest production (21,700 units), emphasizing a need for operational adjustments.

📉 How I Conducted the Analysis:
📌 Used Google Sheets for data analysis & visualization.
📌 Applied Variance & Trend Analysis to track performance.
📌 Conducted Benchmarking to compare actual vs. target production.
